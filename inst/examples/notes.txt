# Glow plot examples

Some of these examples are too large to fit in memory on a common desktop environment.
Could be re-worked to be processed piece-wise.
Do not blindly source the example scripts in this directory.

Bug-fix: 
In version 0.11 point radius was implemented incorrectly. 
In version 0.12 adjust radius in these examples by squaring each value. 

Result images are compressed with https://tinypng.com/ for vignettes.
